"What are the ideal growing conditions for Pineapple MD2?"

Pineapple MD2 thrives in well-drained sandy loam soils with a pH of 4.5 to 6.5. It prefers a tropical climate with temperatures between 20°C to 30°C and requires full sunlight. Regular watering is crucial, especially during the dry season, but avoid waterlogging.
"How often should I water my chilli plants?"

Chilli plants typically require watering 2-3 times per week, depending on the soil and climate conditions. The soil should be kept moist but not waterlogged. Reduce watering as the fruits mature to enhance flavor.
"How can I control pests in my chilli farm organically?"

You can use neem oil, garlic spray, or insecticidal soaps to manage pests like aphids and mites organically. Introducing beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, can also help control pest populations. Crop rotation and maintaining garden hygiene are crucial for long-term pest management.
"When is the right time to harvest Pineapple MD2 for the best sweetness?"

Pineapple MD2 should be harvested when the skin color turns golden yellow, indicating ripeness. Typically, this is 18 to 24 months after planting. The fruit should also have a sweet aroma and yield slightly to pressure.
"What is the best fertilizer to use for cucumbers?"

Use a balanced fertilizer like 10-10-10 (N-P-K) or a slightly higher nitrogen fertilizer such as 20-10-10 early in the growth stage. Once flowering begins, switch to a fertilizer higher in potassium to promote fruit development, such as 5-10-10.
"What is the current market price for Pineapple MD2?"

Market prices for Pineapple MD2 can vary significantly based on location, season, and demand. It’s best to check local markets, agricultural extensions, or online agricultural marketplaces for up-to-date pricing.
"What sustainable practices can I implement in my Pineapple MD2 farm?"

Implementing crop rotation, using organic fertilizers, practicing integrated pest management (IPM), and utilizing drip irrigation to conserve water are all sustainable practices. Mulching can also help retain soil moisture and reduce weed growth.
